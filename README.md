This is a AI workflow for generating test cases in Jira component-AIO test.
1. Requirements comes from Jira tickets.
2. Use AI assistent tool, such as Cline,Copilot.
3. Give workflow_create_testcase.md as the workflow prompt to AI.
4. At the same time, you need to tell AI the Jira ticket id(such as, PROJ-100), clarify the requirements if necessary.(sometimes POs don't spend much time on writing Jira tickets)
5. Test cases will be generated in AIO test. The case tickets link to the related Jira tickets.
